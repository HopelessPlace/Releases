# Releases
PBO Releases of Altis Life for the Hopeless Place Gameserver

# How to build a release.

You need a windows machine with PBO manager and you need to use your brain.
A bit.

Find this URL and download the stuff to a local directory which is called HOP44_Life.Altis:

https://github.com/HopelessPlace/Altis/tree/master/upstream/ArmaLife/Altis-4.4r1/Altis_Life.Altis

Then add our changes from https://github.com/HopelessPlace/Altis/tree/master/Altis_Life.Altis to the directory.

Make sure you are copy-pasting correctly and overwrite all existing files.

Turn the HOP44_Life.Altis folder into the PBO file HOP44_Life.Altis.pbo.

Upload this PBO file to the mpmissions folder of the altislife arma3 server you want to deploy to.
